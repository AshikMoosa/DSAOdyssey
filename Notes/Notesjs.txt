#Basic Input and Output - JS

#Input 
-window.prompt() - prompt(text, defaultText) - let person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
-If the user clicks "OK", the input value is returned. Otherwise null is returned.

#Output 
-console.log(), document.write(), window.alert(), innerHTML
-the window object is the global scope object. Hence window keyword is optional.
-JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
-You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.

#DataTypes - JS
JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
-String   - Strings can contain any sequence of characters, and there are no specific minimum or maximum values for strings.
-Number   - Minimum value: -(2^53 - 1) or -Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (approximately -9007199254740991) , Maximum value: 2^53 - 1 or Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (approximately 9007199254740991)
-Bigint   - Minimum value: -(2^53 - 1) , Maximum value: 2^53 - 1 
-Boolean  - The Boolean data type has two possible values: true and false.
-Undefined- The value of an uninitialized variable is undefined.
-Null     - The Null data type has only one value, which is null.
-Symbol   - Symbols are unique and immutable values, and they can be used as property keys for objects.
-Object   - The Object data type represents complex data structures and can hold various properties and values.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Arrays 
- Arrays are objects that can store multiple values of any type.
- JavaScript arrays are untyped: an array element may be of any type, and different elements of the same array may be of different types. 
- Array elements may even be objects or other arrays, which allows you to create complex data structures, such as arrays of objects and arrays of arrays.
- JavaScript arrays are zero-based and use 32-bit indexes: the index of the first element is 0, and the highest possible index is 4294967294 (2^32âˆ’2), for a maximum array size of 4294967295 (2^32-1) elements.
- JavaScript arrays are dynamic: they grow or shrink as needed and there is no need to declare a fixed size for the array when you create it or to reallocate it when the size changes.
- JavaScript arrays may be sparse: the elements need not have contiguous indexes and there may be gaps.
- Every JavaScript array has a length property.
- For nonsparse arrays, this property specifies the number of elements in the array.
- For sparse arrays, length is larger than the index of all elements.


#1D
-const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
-const cars = [];
-const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
-const cars = new Array(10);                      // cars.length => 10.

#2D
-let myArray = [
[0, 1, 2, 3], 
[4, 5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 0, 0]
];
