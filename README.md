# DailyCodingChallenge

A simple project which includes study materials or notes to popular data structures and algorithms.
Problems and solutions to coding problems from popular coding platforms like GFG &amp; Leetcode to continuously evaluate coding skills.

Solutions will be coded in javascript and java. More languages may be added in future

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to keep problems organized by categories and provide explanations for each solution. Here's an overview:

- [Notes](./Notes/)
- [Section Basics](./Section1 - Basics/)
  - [Patterns](./Section1 - Basics/Patterns/)
  - [Math](./Section1 - Basics/Math/)
  - [Recursion](./Section1 - Basics/Recursion/)
  - [Hashing](./Section1 - Basics/Hashing/)
- [Section-2 Sorting](./Section2 - Sorting/)
- [Section3 - Arrays](./Section3 - Arrays/)
  - [Easy](./Section3 - Arrays/Easy/)
  - [Medium](./Section3 - Arrays/Medium/)
  - [Hard](./Section3 - Arrays/Hard/)

Each category folder contains problem solutions, explanations, and any relevant resources. Problems are further organized into separate folders within the respective category.
