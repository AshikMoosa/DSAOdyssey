Problem-1
Given a number N & string Name. Print Names N Times using recursion.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Name = abc
Output:
abc
abc
abc

Problem-2
Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Problem-3
Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Problem-4
Given and integer N.Calculate the sum of series 13 + 23 + 33 + 43 + â€¦ till N-th term.

Example 1:

Input:
N=5
Output:
225
Explanation:
13+23+33+43+53=225

Constraints:
1<=N<=50000

Problem-5
A number N is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number N, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to N.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 
1 which is less than equal to N. The second 
number is 2 which is less than equal to N,
but the third factorial number is 6 which 
is greater than N. So we print only 1 and 2.
Example 2:

Input: N = 6
Output: 1 2 6
Explanation: The first three factorial 
numbers are less than equal to N but 
the fourth factorial number 24 is 
greater than N. So we print only first 
three factorial numbers.

Constraints:
1<=N<=1018
