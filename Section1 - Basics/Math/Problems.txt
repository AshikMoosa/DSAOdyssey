Problem-1
Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divides N.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 12
Output:
2
Explanation:
1, 2 both divide 12 evenly

Example 2:

Input:
N = 23
Output
0
Explanation:
2 and 3, none of them
divide 23 evenly

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 
Constraints:
1<=N<=105

Problem-2
Given a 32 bit number X, reverse its binary form and print the answer in decimal.

Example 1:

Input:
X = 1
Output:
2147483648 
Explanation:
Binary of 1 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000001
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10000000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2147483648.

Example 2:

Input:
X = 5
Output:
2684354560 
Explanation:
Binary of 5 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000101
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10100000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2684354560.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(X))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= X < 232

Problem-3
Given an integer, check whether it is a palindrome or not.

Example 1:

Input: n = 555
Output: Yes

Example 2:

Input: n = 123
Output: No

Expected Time Complexity: O(x)
Expected Space Complexity: O(x) where x is number of digits in n.
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000

Problem-4
Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD. 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.

Example 2:

Input:
A = 14 , B = 8
Output:
56 2
Explanation:
LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while
thier GCD is 2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= A,B <= 1018

Problem-5
For a given 3 digit number, find whether it is armstrong number or not.

Example 1:

Input: N = 153
Output: "Yes"
Explanation: 153 is an Armstrong number
since 13 + 53 + 33 = 153.
Hence answer is "Yes".

Example 2:

Input: N = 370
Output: "Yes"
Explanation: 370 is an Armstrong number
since 33 + 73 + 03 = 370.
Hence answer is "Yes".

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
100 â‰¤ n <1000

Problem-6
Given a positive integer N, Find Sum of all divisors from 1 to n

Input:
N = 4
Output:
15
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
ans = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7
    = 15

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
21
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
F(5) = 1 + 5 = 6
ans = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6
    = 21

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106

Problem-7
Given a number, check whether it is prime or not.A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by 1 and by itself.

Output: Prime
Explanation: 3 is divisible by 1,3

Example 2:
Input: N = 4
Output: Non-Prime
Explanation: 4  is divisible by 1,2,4
