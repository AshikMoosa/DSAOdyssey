Problem-1
Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divides N.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 12
Output:
2
Explanation:
1, 2 both divide 12 evenly
Example 2:

Input:
N = 23
Output
0
Explanation:
2 and 3, none of them
divide 23 evenly

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 
Constraints:
1<=N<=105
