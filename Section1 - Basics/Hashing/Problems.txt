Problem-1
Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. 
Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N.
Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and do modify the array in-place.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 3, 5}
P = 5
Output:
0 2 2 0 1
Explanation: 
Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 2 times.
3 occurring 2 times.
4 occurring 0 times.
5 occurring 1 time.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {3,3,3,3}
P = 3
Output:
0 0 4 0
Explanation: 
Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 0 times.
3 occurring 4 times.
4 occurring 0 times.

Can you solve this problem without using extra space (O(1) Space)?

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ P ≤ 4*104 
1 <= A[i] <= P

Problem-2
Given a non-empty array of integers, find the top k elements which have the highest frequency in the array. If two numbers have the same frequency then the larger number should be given preference. 

Note: Print the elements according to the frequency count (from highest to lowest) and if the frequency is equal then larger number will be given preference.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
nums = {1,1,1,2,2,3}
k = 2
Output: {1, 2}
Example 2:

Input:
N = 8
nums = {1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4}
k = 2
Output: {3, 2}
Explanation: Elements 1 and 2 have the
same frequency ie. 2. Therefore, in this
case, the answer includes the element 2
as 2 > 1.

Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1<=A[i]<=105
