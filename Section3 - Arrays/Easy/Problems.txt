Problem-1
Given an array A[] of size n. The task is to find the largest element in it.
 
Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1, 8, 7, 56, 90}
Output:
90
Explanation:
The largest element of given array is 90.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n<= 10^3
0 <= A[i] <= 10^3
Array may contain duplicate elements. 

Problem-2
Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
Output:
[3,2]
Explanation:
The seclargest is 3 and secSmallest is 2

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 <= n<= 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
Array may contain duplicate elements.
